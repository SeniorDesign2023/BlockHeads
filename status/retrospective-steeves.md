Answer the 4 following questions about your project.  You may likely have some of this in the status messages. 
1.	What went well?
Our group worked well together this semester. We were able to clearly identify what our MVP is going to be and how we plan to go about getting there. We were able to regularly meet and get our plans put together. We were able to meet with both UW and the state to come up with solution for validation. 
2.	What didn't go so well?
We really didn’t have anything that didn’t go as planned. We just were faced with challenges that we have been able to research and work around. 
3.	What have we learned?
I have learned that there is a lot of legal requirements needed to get a true validation to work. I also learned a lot about the different software’s that we will be using to complete this project. 
4.	What are still issues/problems/puzzles?
The challenges that we are now facing is producing the MVP.
 
What recommendations would you make for Senior design 1 for next fall?  (The is not an evaluation of Jim or Lars, just about the class structure).
1.	What went well and worked and should be continued?
I likes how it was a relaxed nature and that we had plenty of time to create our project plan. It was nice not having to meet every week to present our win/loses. I like that the mentors were available to meet with us and help us come up with solutions to the challenges that we faced.
2.	What didn't go so well and should be changed?
I would say everything went well and the class worked well the way it was structured.
