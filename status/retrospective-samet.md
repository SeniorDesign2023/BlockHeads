Answer the 4 following questions about your project.  You may likely have some of this in the status messages. 
1.	What went well?
I think our group dynamic was really great. Everyone is excited about this project and actively contributing to making our product successful. It was nice that we were able to meet regularly and update each other on everyone’s progress via Discord. Communication is key. We also managed to find solutions to some challenges we were facing. 
2.	What didn't go so well?
So far, I think everything went well for our group. Yes, we have some challenges regarding our project but that’s the case for everyone. 
3.	What have we learned?
I learned that not everything always goes to plan especially when it comes to innovative projects like this. I also learned there’s several legal aspects to our product that we initially did not consider. Also, communication and teamwork is crucial for a class like this. 
4.	What are still issues/problems/puzzles?
Yes, there are some challenges regarding integration of blockchain aspect and some verification parts as well. We will probably encounter more challenges as we start the development process for our MVP. But we are definitely learning a lot and will gain great development experience from this project. 
 
What recommendations would you make for Senior design 1 for next fall?  (The is not an evaluation of Jim or Lars, just about the class structure).
1.	What went well and worked and should be continued?
I love how the class was super laid-back and the structure or assignments were not overwhelming but instead very helpful in keeping track of group progress. Our professors did a great job in providing feedback. 
2.	What didn't go so well and should be changed?
Everything went well. I really would not change anything for this class.
