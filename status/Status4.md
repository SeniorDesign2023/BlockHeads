1. Recap:

Over the past couple of weeks, our group has been continuing working with AWS server. We are almost done with the basic design process of the Android app. We have started working on our databases and figured out what kind of data we needed and created them through MySQL. Moreover, we have been making progress with creating our API and figuring out different ways to implement smart contracts within our app.

2. Tasks completed:
A. Description of tasks completed:
    1. We have created our databases.
    2. We have started working on our mock API.
    3. We are exploring options for Blockchain smart contracts.
    4. We researched Google play store regulations for app publishing.
B. Your choice of quantifiable metric:
    1. The group has finalized all programming languages needed.
    2. Planning on meeting once to twice a week for a couple hours to work together.
    3. Basic Android app development is almost done.
3. Successes:
i. Group accomplishments:

- We finalized our app logo.
- We were able to solve our previous issues with AWS server.
- We have our databases.
- We are almost done with designing our Android app and running it.
- We figured out the requirements needed for authentication measures and how we want to go about them.

ii. Successful solutions:

- We terminated the previous server with instances and tried again to clear memory space.

iii. Other things tried:

- n/a

4. Challenges:
i. Describe the challenges:

- The system is only allowing one connection to the database, so we are navigating that. Figuring out what needs to be on the server exactly and testing it is another challenge. Also, we are trying to figure out the best way to go about Blockchain smart contracts.

ii. Describe how you overcame them:

- We are still doing some research about Blockchain smart contract approaches and discussing the server.
- We are exploring using a web server behind the database.

iii. What challenges are still left?

- Finding the best approach from smart contracts.
- Making sure we donâ€™t overload our databases.
- Figuring out what needs to be on the server exactly.
- Implementing the authentication and security measures.

iv. What do you need help with? How can a mentor help?

- We have received great advice from our mentors and no help is needed now.

5. Changes/deviations:

- No current changes as of now.

6. Detailed description of goals for next 3 weeks:

Week1: Finishing the design process of the Android app and testing it. Continue working on our server and finishing up the databases.

Week2: Continue working on organizing our databases and the server. Start working on API and our mock data. Working on implementing the smart contracts.

Week3: Continue working on API. Implementing the authentication measures.

7. Confidence:

We are confident in our project (5).
