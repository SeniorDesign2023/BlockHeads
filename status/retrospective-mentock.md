1.	What went well?
We worked very well together as a group, and we were able to communicate clearly and often. We were able to zero in on our minimum viable product quickly, as well as dividing the work evenly and fairly. We met with some very important resources, and they helped us to discover some shortcomings in our plan, as well as allowed us to better understand what we need to do to make a successful product.

2.	What didn't go so well?
Very few things went really wrong, other than some minor snags with our initial plans. We had the University raise some valid concerns about data security and requisition procedures, which we had to address and come up with solutions.

3.	What have we learned?
So far, we have definitely had to learn how to create more centralized applications in a decentralized manner. The benefits of Blockchain often come from its decentralization, and to effectively utilize those benefits while still having certain centralized protocols and databases, we needed to figure out an effective way to blend them. This problem has not fully been solved, but we are well on our way.

4.	What are still issues/problems/puzzles?
Our main issue is still that we need to actually implement our minimum viable product, and come up with a way to address all of the functionality we hope to include. We will also need to figure out how to get all of the pieces to function well together, which will be a challenge in and of itself.

What recommendations would you make for Senior design 1 for next fall? (This is not an evaluation of Jim or Lars, just about the class structure).

5.	What went well and worked and should be continued?
Our group dynamic was really great this semester, and we worked very well together. We supported each other when we needed support, and were able to get our MVP planned out early in the semester. The meetings with our mentor were helpful, and were frequent enough to help keep us on track. In terms of the class structure, I have no real concerns or improvements in mind. It gives the groups enough structure to have every opportunity to succeed, but isn’t oppressive or controlling over the specifics of group work.
 
6.	What didn't go so well and should be changed?
For our group, we didn’t really have much that went wrong. As for other groups, I’m not sure. If there would be some sort of reflection over the specifics of group work at the end of the semester, that may help groups convey to the instructors who fully participated and who may not have pulled their weight. Other than that, I don’t have any other specific concerns about the structure of the class. It has been a helpful and well-balanced course, and it has set us up well to implement our product next semester.
