Answer the 4 following questions about your project.  You may likely have some of this in the status messages. 
1.	What went well?
Our group worked really well together! Our planning went well. It was messy, as these things are, but it evolved and we met regularly and we are (I am) excited to work on the project. It was great that we were able to meet with UW and the state and to come up with solutions to the challenges of validation.
2.	What didn't go so well?
I honestly don’t have anything to put here. I think it went really well.  It’s messy and our plan evolved, but that’s to be expected.
3.	What have we learned?
We learned a lot. As we were making our plan, we’d research how best to solve a problem, and we’d discuss possible solutions, and each member of the group had valuable contributions to solving problems.  We all added the resources we knew to our efforts. 
4.	What are still issues/problems/puzzles?
At the moment, the only challenge remaining is to actually to create our minimum viable product. We feel good about that, with a way to slightly contract it if necessary but also with stretch goals if we have time.
What recommendations would you make for Senior design 1 for next fall?  (The is not an evaluation of Jim or Lars, just about the class structure).
1.	What went well and worked and should be continued?
All of it! I love the laid-back nature of what we’re doing. I like that we had off weeks so that our group could just meet at that time and didn’t have to try to find another time. I love that Jim and Lars were fairly hands-off but with support and regular meetings and check-ins. You are responsive.  I love how everything evolved, and we had to be flexible and find solutions—just like in a professional setting. Please continue doing it this way!
2.	What didn't go so well and should be changed?
•	Our group kept meeting notes, which I think is tremendously helpful. Of course, I would say that, since I kept them, and you’d have to ask the rest of the group whether they found it helpful, but I really did, especially when making the other documents we needed to make and attaching meeting notes to show our progress. I got this from Kim’s Software Design class (and my work at the UW Foundation) and I think it’s a valuable tool.
•	Our group works really well together. However, for those groups that don’t, a tool that might be helpful (that Kim had in Software Design) is this: at the end of the semester, have each person turn in a short evaluation of group members.  They could voice their concerns about other team members and rate each other on their performance.  I don’t like rating myself (as I have this thing where I undervalue my own performance) but I think it’s valuable for you to be able to see inside group dynamics and if one person is really slacking. In fact, a midsemester checkin and then a final checkin like this might be helpful.
