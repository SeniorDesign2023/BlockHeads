1.	Recap: 
Over the past couple of weeks, our group has been working on getting familiarized with the AWS server and
establishing a successful connection.We have finalized the programming languages we will be using for each
of the components of our app. We have also started laying out the basic design of our application and are
currently in the process of designing it as well as picking out our logo. Moreover, we have been conducting
in-depth research about creating our own API, the integration of blockchain technology and implementing security
measures. We have started the development process of the android app.

3.	Tasks completed: 
  A.	Description of tasks completed:
    a.	We have established connection with AWS server.
    b.	We started working on our databases.
    c.	We got the base android application template design running.
    d.	We have reached out to WyoDOT about data for validation process.
  B.	Your choice of quantifiable metric:
    a.	The group met twice in the two weeks.
    b.	Planning on having bi-weekly meetings. 
    c.	Basic Android app development. 
    d.	Sever connected and running.
    e.	Working on our individual portions each week. 
4.	Successes:
  i.	Group accomplishments:
    •	We customized our app logo.
    •	We got our AWS server up and running. 
    •	We started our Android App development.
    •	Researching the best way to create custom API for our databases.
  ii.	Successful solutions: 
    •	We connected our server using personal email. Had challenges setting up accounts with university emails.
  iii.	Other things tried: 
    •	We have tried launching instances on our AWS server.
    •	We have started the development of Android app and working on making the UI/UX as we would like it.
    •	We are trying to clear up memory in our AWS server. 

5.	Challenges:
  i.	Describe the challenges:
    •	Navigating the AWS server took a lot more time than expected. 
    •	We ran out of AWS memory with our several instance types. 
    •	Learning how to navigate and use Android Studios.
  ii.	Describe how you overcame them:
    •	We are still doing some research about AWS to figure out how to remove all the instance types we
  	have for memory. In the meantime, we have terminated our instance completely. 
    •	We have done research on how to use android studios. As well we have used Ward resources for building android app.
  iii.	What challenges are still left?
    •	Customizing our own API
    •	Figuring out what needs to be on the server exactly. 
    •	Organizing our databases.
    •	Managing the blockchain portion. 
  iv.	What do you need help with? How can a mentor help?
    •	We have received great advice from our mentors and no help is needed now. 

7.	Changes/deviations:                                                                                                                                
  •	No changes now. We are sticking to our original plan. 
8.	Detailed description of goals for next 3 weeks: 
  Week1: Find solutions for instance type issue, reach out to WyoDot and IT again for progress update
   and information needed for the success of our project. Continue working on Android app and figure out what is needed on the server. 
  Week2: Make progress in the design process of our application. Work on database format and blockchain implementation.
  Week3: Have databases data formatted and created. Start working on the development of API for the databases.
10.	Confidence:
We are confident in our project (5).
