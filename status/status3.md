- We have also started laying out the basic design of our application and are currently in the process of designing it as well as picking out our logo.
- Moreover, we have been conducting in-depth research about creating our own API, the integration of blockchain technology, and implementing security measures.
- We have started the development process of the android app.

**Tasks completed:**
- Description of tasks completed:
  - We have established connection with AWS server.
  - We started working on our databases.
  - We got the base android application template design running.
  - We have reached out to WyoDOT about data for the validation process.
- Your choice of quantifiable metric:
  - The group met twice in the two weeks.
  - Planning on having bi-weekly meetings.
  - Basic Android app development.
  - Server connected and running.
  - Working on our individual portions each week.

**Successes:**
- Group accomplishments:
  - We customized our app logo.
  - We got our AWS server up and running.
  - We started our Android App development.
  - Researching the best way to create a custom API for our databases.
- Successful solutions:
  - We connected our server using personal email. Had challenges setting up accounts with university emails.
- Other things tried:
  - We have tried launching instances on our AWS server.
  - We have started the development of the Android app and working on making the UI/UX as we would like it.
  - We are trying to clear up memory in our AWS server.

**Challenges:**
- Describe the challenges:
  - Navigating the AWS server took a lot more time than expected.
  - We ran out of AWS memory with our several instance types.
  - Learning how to navigate and use Android Studios.
- Describe how you overcame them:
  - We are still doing some research about AWS to figure out how to remove all the instance types we have for memory. In the meantime, we have terminated our instance completely.
  - We have done research on how to use Android Studios. As well we have used Ward resources for building the Android app.
- What challenges are still left?
  - Customizing our own API.
  - Figuring out what needs to be on the server exactly.
  - Organizing our databases.
  - Managing the blockchain portion.
- What do you need help with? How can a mentor help?
  - We have received great advice from our mentors and no help is needed now.

**Changes/deviations:**
- No changes now. We are sticking to our original plan.

**Detailed description of goals for the next 3 weeks:**
- **Week 1:**
  - Find solutions for instance type issue.
  - Reach out to WyoDot and IT again for progress update and information needed for the success of our project.
  - Continue working on Android app and figure out what is needed on the server.
- **Week 2:**
  - Make progress in the design process of our application.
  - Work on database format and blockchain implementation.
- **Week 3:**
  - Have databases data formatted and created.
  - Start working on the development of API for the databases.

**Confidence:** We are confident in our project (5).
