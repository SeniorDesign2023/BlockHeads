1. **Project Goals:** 
   1. Develop a blockchain-enabled Android app to securely store and manage personal identity documents and credentials where users have control over accessing their credentials. 
   1. Achieve our minimum viable product and graduate. :)

1. **Project Planning and Execution:**
1. **Design Requirements and Specification (minimum viable product):**
   1. Target verifying one or both a Wyoming driver’s license/ID and a UW degree,
   1. Login, 2FA, and recovery of passwords,
   1. An android interface,
   1. Smart contracts to interact with blockchain and blockchain to store IDs and
      credentials,
   1. A server to interact with devices and the blockchain,
   1. A database for temporary and system data mirrored between a device and the server, and
   1. A procedure to verify with UW and Wyoming.
1. **Finalized Plan of Work**
1. Fall 2023: Develop our minimum viable product. 
1. January 2024: Begin developing each of our portions, dividing work, and building the app.
1. February 2024: Continue development process as well as reach out to resources and mentors for assistance. Making changes according to the feedback provided. Begin work on interoperability of components.
1. March 2024: Continue developing our project, bring it all together, and start vigorous testing.
1. April 2024: Finalize project, bug fixes, finalize presentation, and put everything together.

1. **Summary of Final Implementation:**
   1. **Design:**
      1. Developed a user-friendly android app using Android Studio. 
      1. Implemented security measures such as pins, 2FA, and data encryption. 
      1. Integrated Firebase database for storing user information and validated inputs and used MongoDB for mock data to validate identity and credentials.
      1. Used Node.js and Microsoft Azure for hosting the API that compares input against mock data. 
      1. Implemented smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, integrated it with our Android app using Web3j and used Metamask wallet for transactions. 
   1. **Limitations:**
      1. Resources constraints, as we were not able to connect with APIs for WYDOT and UW. 
      1. Time constraints as our project scope was short and we ran into several challenges along the way that forced us to change directions.  
      1. Technical constraints with encountering challenges with blockchain and AWS as we had no previous experience using these resources and they were challenging, so it took a lot of time trying different approaches. 
   1. **Future Directions\*:**
      1. Transitioning from mock data to real data by collaborating with third parties that can validate the data needed. 
      1. Add support for other types of documents (passports, visas, birth certificates).
      1. Implement tokenized credentials associated with user wallets for added security. 
      1. Implement expiration date reminders.
      1. Integrate QR code verification functionality for secure sharing.
      1. Enable users to add secondary owner functionality.
      1. Adding security measures such as forgotten password recovery and email verification. 

         ` `This assumes we would continue to develop our project.

   1. **Statement of Work:**
      1. **Whole Team:**
         1. Our team coordinated efforts, delegated tasks where each member was tasked with specific responsibilities and communicated regularly to accomplish our project goals. The entire group contributed throughout the phases of planning, development and testing of our product. 
      1. **1 Per Team Member:**
         1. Megan - App, UI, databases, API, server, security
         1. Tamara - Validation, server, databases, blockchain, app, documentation
         1. Selma - Documentation, security, app
         1. Kellen - Blockchain, presentation

1. **Refection on Team’s ability to design, implement, and evaluate a solution:**
   1. **Lessons Learned:**
      1. We had to adjust who worked on what and our expectations and goals as the project progressed.
      1. Communication and teamwork are essential for the success of a project.
      1. There will be times when it is all-hands-on-deck process. 
      1. Connecting lots of moving parts together is hard.
      1. There is never enough good documentation.
   1. **“If you had to do it all over again”:**
      1. Do more research on products and tools that we will be using before starting the process to limit the loss time in finding in trying other products and tools but knowing full well that we may not be able to assess something until we try it.
      1. Start developing the MVP as early as possible. 
   1. **Advice for Future teams:**
      1. Figure out how team members are going to communicate and where things will be stored. Discord worked really well for us.
      1. Possibly jot down and share meeting notes on what was decided, especially early on.
      1. Don’t use AWS unless you have a mentor that knows AWS and is willing to help in the development process. 
      1. Research multiple products and tools in advance before starting the project to be prepared for challenges and needing to change directions.
      1. Be flexible and prepared for things to not go as planned, as you will often encounter unexpected challenges along the way. 
      1. Be flexible with group assignments and everyone pitch in as much as possible.
      1. Meet during class time on those weeks where there is not class and be prepared to meet a lot toward the end.
      1. There will be a crunch at the end.
